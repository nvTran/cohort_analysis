# cohort_analysis_on_Google_Colab_with_Cloud_SQL
This repo demonstrates how to connect to an online database instance using proxy, perform cohort analysis on Google Colab and export output google sheets.  

Cohort analysis is a common behavioral analytics. Basically we group of users with the same characteristic as a cohort and perform analysis. For example, we can perform cohort analysis on customers of a service. We can group them by registration date and analyze their spending behaviour over the time which allows us to deduce valuable insights about sales and marketing strategies that different groups experience. 

Google Colab allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything on your own computer other than a browser
Colab runs on a range of IPs whenever we connect to runtimes, we are only to connect to Google Cloud SQL database by using proxy. After running analysis on the notebook, we can export the output to Google Sheets for business users to view.
